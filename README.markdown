# iViewer Server SIMPL+ Module - Crestron Integration

The iViewer Server SIMPL+ module is one method of integrating CommandFusion iViewer with Crestron processors.  
It makes use of the Control System protocol built into iViewer, [documented here](http://cmdf.us/controlprotocol)

See the [User Guide PDF](https://github.com/CommandFusion/CrestronModule/tree/master/CommandFusion%20iViewer%20Crestron%20Module%20User%20Guide%20v1.0.2.pdf) for more details

## List Protocol

There is some sample code available for processing list protocol data, and is to be used as a starting point only. These files are not ready for use, rather just samples of how you can use dynamic lists with the module.  
See the [Control system protocol documentation](http://cmdf.us/controlprotocol) for specific details on how list data is generated.
